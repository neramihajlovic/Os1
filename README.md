# Os1
Operating Systems Project – Preemptive Multithreaded Kernel (C++, C, Assembly, RISC-V)
Developed a preemptive multithreaded kernel for a single-core CPU, supporting context switching, event handling, and semaphores
Implemented in C++, C, and assembly for the RISC-V processor architecture
Executed the kernel in a virtual environment using a RISC-V processor emulator
Designed as an entry-level project for the Operating Systems course, simulating the behavior of an educational computer
Gained hands-on experience with low-level programming, concurrency, and kernel architecture
